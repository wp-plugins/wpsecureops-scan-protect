Most of hackers, before trying to attack your site will always try to scan it for vulnerabilities. This plugin will make
that impossible.

== Description ==

Simple plugin, but VERY powerful plugin that similarly to the complex IDS (Intrusion detection system) for web servers,
will protect and detect ANY scan attempts and block them at early stage.

Note: Google, Yahoo and Bing bots will NOT be banned by this plugin. The detection/identification of the bots is done,
by using the ONLY 100% sure way of identifying bots. To add more bots, simply go to your settings page or ask us in our
support forums.

No coding skills required!
